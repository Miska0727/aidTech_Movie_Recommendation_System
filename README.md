# Movie Recommendation System -InfoaidTech Machine Learning Intern Task (aidTech_Movie_Recommendation_System)

## Introduction

This machine learning project aims to build a movie recommendation system that can suggest movies to users based on their preferences. We will implement a collaborative filtering algorithm, a technique that recommends movies to users by considering their ratings and the ratings of similar users.

## Project Tasks

### 1. Load the MovieLens Dataset

We will start by loading the MovieLens dataset into our Python environment. The dataset contains information about user ratings for various movies.

### 2. Importing Pandas

We will utilize the Pandas library for data manipulation and preprocessing.

### 3. Pre-processing the Dataset via Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before building the recommendation system, we will explore and preprocess the dataset. This includes handling missing data, understanding the distribution of ratings, and other exploratory tasks.

### 4. Splitting the Data

To train and evaluate our recommendation system, we'll split the dataset into training and testing sets. This will allow us to measure the system's accuracy.

### 5. Implementing Collaborative Filtering

We will implement a collaborative filtering algorithm to recommend movies. Collaborative filtering considers user ratings and identifies similar users to suggest movies that similar users have enjoyed.

### 6. Training the Model

Using the training set, we will train our collaborative filtering model. The model will learn patterns in user ratings and movie preferences.

### 7. Using Evaluation Metrics

To assess the performance of our recommendation system, we will use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics help measure the accuracy of our predictions.

### 8. Testing on Custom Data

Finally, we will test our recommendation system on custom data to see how well it can provide movie suggestions based on user preferences.
